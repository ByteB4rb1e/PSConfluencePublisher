        .SYNOPSIS
            Test the connectivity to a Confluence instance.

        .DESCRIPTION
            Just making an arbitrary authenticated HTTP request and making sure 
            that we're getting a 2xx status code back. This way we make sure 
            that network connectivity is fine, and that the PAT is valid.
    
            It is required to register a PAT through 
            ``Register-PersonalAccessToken`` beforehand.

        .EXAMPLE
            Test-Connection confluence.contoso.com
    #>
    Param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory, Position = 0)] [string] $Host
    )
